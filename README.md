# Hypothesis Testing using python

## T-Test

A t-test is a type of inferential statistic which is used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups which may be related in certain features

### T-test has 2 types 

### 1. one sampled t-test:
The test will tell us whether means of the sample and the population are different.

### 2. two-sampled t-test:
The Independent Samples t Test or 2-sample t-test compares the means of two independent groups in order to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the associated population means are significantly different. The Independent Samples t Test is a parametric test. This test is also known as: Independent t Test


## Chi Square Test

The test is applied when you have two categorical variables from a single population. It is used to determine whether there is a significant association between the two variables.
